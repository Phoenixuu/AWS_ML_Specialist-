Step follow and deploy model:

1. Import Libraries and Setup

    sagemaker: SageMaker's Python SDK to handle machine learning workflows.
    boto3: AWS SDK for Python, used for interacting with AWS services like S3.
    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    urllib: To download the dataset from a URL.

2. S3 Bucket Setup

    The script checks if the S3 bucket (bankapplication) exists, and if not, creates it in the specified AWS region (us-east-1).

3. Dataset Download and Load

    The dataset is downloaded from a URL and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further processing.

4. Train-Test Split

    The dataset is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

5. Upload Train and Test Data to S3

    The train and test data are preprocessed (columns reordered) and uploaded to the specified S3 bucket.

6. Set up the XGBoost Model with SageMaker

    get_image_uri: Retrieves the URI of the XGBoost Docker container in SageMaker.
    Hyperparameters for XGBoost are set, including max_depth, eta, gamma, and others.

7. SageMaker Estimator Setup

    An estimator is created using the XGBoost container, hyperparameters, role, and instance configuration. It specifies the location of the training data in S3 and the output path for saving the model.

8. Model Training

    The estimator is trained using the data in S3 (train and validation), with logs showing the training progress.

9. Deploy the Model

    Once the training completes, the model is deployed to an endpoint (ml.m4.xlarge instance).

10. Predictions

    The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data, and the results are printed as an array.

11. Confusion Matrix (for Evaluation)

    A confusion matrix is created to evaluate the model's performance by comparing predicted and actual values.
